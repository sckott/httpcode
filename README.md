`httpcode` is a tiny R package to search for and show http code messages and description. It's a port of the Python httpcode (https://github.com/rspivak/httpcode) library.

`httpcode` has no dependencies.

Follows RFC 2616 (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt), and for additional codes 
following RFC 6585 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585).

Structure of information for each status code:

* `status_code` - the status code
* `message` - very brief message explaining the code
* `explanation` - more verbose explanation, but still short
* `explanation_verbose` - the complete explanation

## Installation

Stable version


```r
install.packages("httpcode")
```

Development version


```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("sckott/httpcode")
```


```r
library("httpcode")
```

## Search by http code


```r
http_code(100)
#> <Status code: 100>
#>   Message: Continue
#>   Explanation: Request received, please continue
```


```r
http_code(400)
#> <Status code: 400>
#>   Message: Bad Request
#>   Explanation: Bad request syntax or unsupported method
```


```r
http_code(503)
#> <Status code: 503>
#>   Message: Service Unavailable
#>   Explanation: The server cannot process the request due to a high load
```


```r
http_code(999)
#> Error: No description found for code: 999
```

## Get verbose status code description


```r
http_code(100, verbose = TRUE)
#> <Status code: 100>
#>   Message: Continue
#>   Explanation: Request received, please continue
#>   Verbose Explanation: The client SHOULD continue with its request. This
#>     interim response is used to inform the client that the initial part of the
#>     request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The
#>     client SHOULD continue by sending the remainder of the request or, if the
#>     request has already been completed, ignore this response. The server MUST
#>     send a final response after the request has been completed. See section
#>     8.2.3 for detailed discussion of the use and handling of this status code.
```


```r
http_code(400, verbose = TRUE)
#> <Status code: 400>
#>   Message: Bad Request
#>   Explanation: Bad request syntax or unsupported method
#>   Verbose Explanation: The request could not be understood by the server due to
#>     malformed syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without
#>     modifications.
```
